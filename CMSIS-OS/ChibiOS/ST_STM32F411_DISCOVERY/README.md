* Board power supply: through USB bus or from an external 5 V supply voltage
* External application power supply: 3 V and 5 V
* L3GD20, ST MEMS motion sensor, 3-axis digital output gyroscope.
* LSM303DLHC, ST MEMS system-in-package featuring a 3D digital linear acceleration sensor and a 3D digital magnetic sensor.
* MP45DT02, ST MEMS audio sensor, omnidirectional digital microphone
* CS43L22, audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver
* Eight LEDs:
  - LD1 (red/green) for USB communication
  - LD2 (red) for 3.3 V power on
* Four user LEDs:
  - LD3 (orange), LD4 (green), LD5 (red) and LD6 (blue)
  - Two USB OTG LEDs:
* LD7 (green) VBus and LD8 (red) over-current
* Two pushbuttons (user and reset)
* USB OTG with micro-AB connector
* Extension header for LQFP100 I/Os for a quick connection to the prototyping board and an easy probing

## <span style="font-size:1em;">Supported Features</span>

There are 5 GPIO controllers on the discovery board responsible for the pin usage, their configuration can be found in the [header file responsible for it](board.h)

<span style="font-size:1em;">Basic peripherals available in nanoFramework:</span>

* USART 1, USART2
* I2C1, I2C3
* SPI1, SPI2
* 5 ADC channels
* I2S3
* OTG 
* User Button
* 4 User LEDs
* Gyroscope 
* Acceleration sensor
* Magnetic sensor
* Audio DAC

*Please note that I2C1, SPI1 and I2S3 are used by the on board sensors, audio DAC and can not be used for generic use therefore I2C3 and SPI2 have been made available.*

For more details on what pins the on board sensors can be addressed please refer to the board's [user manual](http://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00148985.pdf) and the previous mentioned [header file](board.h) or the corresponding configuration file in the board's root folder.

## <span style="font-size:1em;">MCU Clock usage</span>

On this board there is no LSE (Low Speed External) XTal fitted. When looking at the board's picture you'll see that there is no X3 (right side and above the main MCU). In case an LSE is soldered do not forget to reflect that in the mcuconf.h files. 

## <span style="font-size:1em;">Serial port</span>

There is no VCP support for the on board ST-Link/V2. That's why a seperate UART-2-USB adapter/converter has to be connected in order to communicate with Visual Studio. This is done thru nanoFramework's wire protocol which is assigned to USART2. Pins PA2, PA3 and a GND pin are needed to establish a serial connection between the discovery board and Visual Studio.
