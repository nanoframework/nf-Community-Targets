## Configuration of ChibiOS, HAL and MCU

For a successful build the following changes are required:

For memory maps, uuid etc. the reference document used was: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/reference_manual/group0/96/8b/0d/ec/16/22/43/71/DM00224583/files/DM00224583.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00224583.pdf

For port maps:
https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um1974-stm32-nucleo144-boards-mb1137-stmicroelectronics.pdf

NOTE: this configuration was successfully tested in an ST_NUCLEO144_F767ZI board using the Serial port through the onboard ST Link USB connection.
